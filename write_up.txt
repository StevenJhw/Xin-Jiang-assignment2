What were some challenges you faced while making this app? 

During the app development, I encountered challenges with deployment, including
selecting the appropriate cloud service provider, configuring servers,
and troubleshooting network issues. Designing global and local variables
also posed challenges, as I needed to carefully manage their scope and
ensure proper data sharing across the application. These challenges
required meticulous planning and technical expertise to overcome,
ultimately leading to the successful development of the application.



Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make

With more time, I would focus on streamlining the codebase to make it more concise and maintainable. 
Additionally, I would implement additional features aimed at enhancing user-friendliness, such as incorporating 
intuitive navigation options, improving error handling for smoother user interactions, and adding more customization
options to tailor the app experience to individual preferences. Furthermore, I would explore opportunities for 
optimizing performance and scalability to ensure the app can accommodate future growth and usage demands effectively.


What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?

While working on this assignment, I made the assumption that users would have basic familiarity with interactive 
applications and would understand how to interact with buttons to engage with the game. Additionally, I assumed that
users would be interested in learning more about the game through the provided introduction and would appreciate the 
opportunity to interact with it through the "point and click" button functionality. These assumptions guided the design
and implementation decisions to create a user-friendly and engaging experience for the target audience.



How long did this assignment take to complete? (Obviously, this does not need to be a paragraph)
~25h



What bonus points 
1.Clustered Setup:
segment iterates to generate a specific number of "clusters" within a grid. Each cluster comprises a center
point randomly positioned and marked as a living cell. Subsequently, additional living cells are randomly generated 
around this central point within a specified range, effectively forming a cluster. The outcome is the creation of 
several high-density areas of living cells within the grid, known as clusters, which are more likely to have living 
cells at the start of the game compared to other regions.

2.Autoplay Feature 
3.Longer Lasting Cells
